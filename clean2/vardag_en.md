## Info

### In case of an outbreak of stomach disease
- To see the cleaning routines that apply to during a outbreak of stomach illness, select "Stomach flu" at the top of this page.
- In the event of an outbreak of stomach illness, the staff will put up a note on the cleaning schedule with the text <b> Virkon </b>.
- If there is mixed Virkon, use it. Check that the date does not exceed 5 days.
- If the solution is too old or out of stock mix new solution. Instructions and materials are in the cupboard to the left of the door between the changing room and the playroom.

### Tips and tricks
- Always hang the mops and cloths on the rim of the laundry basket.
- Don't put the chairs standing on the tables, put them up-side-down or hang them on the side of the table.
- Don't forget to put down all the latches, including the door out to the yard.
- Don't use to much water when mopping. Too much water on the floor make bacteria grow and can damage the floor.
- Don't use any cleaning Chemicals on the floor, not even "såpa". Use water on "stubborn" smudges.
